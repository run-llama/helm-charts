## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

## Adding the helm repository:

```sh
# Add helm repository
helm repo add llamaindex https://run-llama.github.io/helm-charts

# (Optional) Update your helm local cache
helm repo update

# Find available charts in the llamaindex repo
helm search repo llamaindex
```

## Validate

There is a set of automated tests [here](https://github.com/run-llama/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/llamacloud/deployment_tests) that can be run to validate parts of the functionality of your deployment. It is recommended to run these tests after the initial installation of the helm chart and after every upgrade to the helm chart.

## Runbooks
A collection of runbooks for common scenarios can be found in the [runbooks directory](./runbooks/) of this repo.
